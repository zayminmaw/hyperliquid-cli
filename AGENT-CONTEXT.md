# AGENT-CONTEXT

> Last updated: 2026-07-07 | Session: 7a committed; 7b BUILT (hl journal digest + cached opus narrative, wired into agent daily job); 377 tests pass; live-verified; 7b uncommitted

---

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK

- Task: Phase 7 — Agent mode: autonomous supervisor + daily journal + reflection memory + Mode A adoption (PLAN.md §15)
- Goal: 7a supervisor + intake dir ✅ → 7b `hl journal` ✅ → 7c reflection inject + scheduled tuners → 7d sentry adopts Mode A
- Status: 7b complete, uncommitted (7a committed by user). Gate live-verified: journal reconciles with `exec report`; real opus reflection written + cached
- Next action: commit 7b, then build 7c (`reflections` table + bounded "recent lessons" inject into decision prompt + sentry context; tuner scheduled in agent loop, auto-promote paper only)
- Blocked by: none

---

## 📍 LAST ACTION

- Did: built 7b — `journal/digest.py` (day slice via new `decisions_between`/`sentry_between`; per-verdict rationale lines, gate-reason tally, R/expectancy/PF, sentry+alert tallies, report-reconciling snapshot), `journal/narrative.py` (opus, trader persona, judge-process-not-P&L), `journal/writer.py` (narrative cached per-date in meta — one call/day ever; failure ⇒ placeholder + alert, digest always writes), `hl journal write|show|ls`, agent daily job now writes YESTERDAY's journal; `tuner.promote.pending_proposals()` shared helper; caps `HL_JOURNAL_MODEL/MAX_TOKENS`, tunable `agent.journal_narrative`
- Result: 377 pass (9 new); live: journal reconciled with report; real opus reflection flagged unauditable skips → digest enriched with rationale lines same session; rewrite reused cache
- File(s) touched: journal/* (new), cli/commands/{journal(new),agent}.py, cli/app.py, state/store.py, core/{config,config_schema}.py, tuner/promote.py, .env.example, tests/test_journal.py (new), tests/test_cli.py, docs/{cli,modules}.md, ACTION-ITEMS.md

## 🧠 DECISIONS

- [2026-06-27] LLM owns judgment, code owns mechanics + safety (full statement lives in CLAUDE.md); hard caps in .env; tunable surface clamped on load; anthropic + exchange deps lazy; sonnet-4-6 order path / opus-4-8 tuner; idempotency key recorded BEFORE fire
- [2026-07-01] wait→follow-up: act+wait DEFERRED not rejected; re-check inside freshness, `HL_FOLLOWUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; frozen while breaker tripped; re-checks labeled via `followup` in context
- [2026-07-02] Non-finite numbers NEVER clamp: NaN slides through min/max as the UPPER bound, so conviction/recheck are dropped and tunables fall back to defaults (`math.isfinite` everywhere a clamp guards money)
- [2026-07-02] Gate mark-sanity: the entry is a MARKET order ⇒ mark must exist, sit strictly inside sl/tp, and R:R **at the mark** must clear the floor; sizing + notional/leverage caps priced at the mark, not the proposed entry
- [2026-07-02] Ledger-first fills: trades row written on fill BEFORE protection; failed protection ⇒ emergency close + cancel placed triggers + row resolved `aborted` (was: no ledger). Positions the ledger doesn't know raise an edge-triggered `unmanaged_position` alert
- [2026-07-02] Shadow books hypothetical trades (`trades.shadow=1`, entry at mark) resolved orderlessly — THIS is the tuner/graduation training data; shadow passes never touch real trades; hypothetical book honors one-per-coin
- [2026-07-05] Sentry (PLAN.md §14): deterministic mechanics FIRST (6a trail engine, all rules default off) → 6b LLM shadow judged vs that baseline → 6c gated live ↓risk → 6d ADD last; sentry never originates trades (user-confirmed: manages positions + enters deferred WAITs)
- [2026-07-05] R anchors to `initial_sl` once the stop ratchets; a profit-side stop-out books `won`; `scaled` partials count as wins; live stop replace = place-new-then-cancel-old (reject ⇒ old level kept everywhere); scale-out idempotent via `sentry:scale:<id>` recorded before the order
- [2026-07-06] 6b shadow-only: proposals logged PAIRED with the 6a baseline (baseline never in the model's context — no anchoring); `hl sentry once|run` = `run_once(include_intake=False)` watch pass (deferred re-entry shares attempts/idempotency with exec; intake stays exec's)
- [2026-07-07] Phase 7 (§15): repo stays producer-agnostic + OSS — signal handoff = watched JSON-batch intake dir, NO open port/HTTP; adoption never invents a stop (alert+skip); reflection inject bounded + own-outcomes-only; tuner auto-promote paper ONLY (testnet/mainnet propose→approve)

## ⚠️ GOTCHAS

- §13 open questions have default choices — confirm with user before a task relies on one.
- Keep no top-level imports of anthropic / hyperliquid / eth_account in hot paths. Verified 2026-07-02 in a fresh core-only venv (scratchpad `hlcore`; old `/tmp/hlcore` is PEP-668-locked, rebuild if needed).
- Marks/book/candles/meta go through **httpx** `/info`, NOT SDK `Info` — don't "simplify" onto the SDK or paper stops being keyless.
- PassSummary counters are disjoint: `rejected` = gate said no; `failed` = gate-approved but died at the exchange (reject/unfilled/aborted). Don't fold them back together.
- Executor entry is a MARKET order; ledger + protection size from `OrderResult.filled_size`/`avg_price`. Don't revert to GTC limit entry (review finding H1).
- test helpers' `caps()` pins `config_path=/nonexistent/...` so prompt/config reads never touch a dev's real `~/.hyperliquid-cli`; tuner tests still pass their own tmp `config_path`.
- Run tests with `.venv/bin/pytest` (bare python3.12 has no pytest). Python 3.12 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`.
- Sentry 6a is inert until the tunable `trail` rules are switched on (all default off); `hl sentry once` tells you when nothing is active.
- Executor tests inject `run_once(..., decide_fn=...)`; real `decide`/tuners tested via fakes. `exec`/`tune run` need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
- `resolved_trades(limit=N)` = most recent N (newest-closed first) — don't assume oldest-first.
- FakeLiveExchange (test_protect) models positions/open_orders/canceled; `fail_triggers="tp"` = partial-protection case.
