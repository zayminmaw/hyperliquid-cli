# AGENT-CONTEXT

> Last updated: 2026-06-30 | Session: Phase 5 done + pre-mainnet self-review fixes applied (152 tests) — all phases complete

---

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK

- Task: Phase 5 — Mainnet hardening ✅ code-complete
- Goal: native exchange-side SL/TP at entry, runtime prereq enforcement, graduation checklist in report, key review, alerting
- Status: done (143 tests pass, 1 skip). Build plan fully implemented through all phases.
- Next action: none coding-side. Remaining is operational — supply agent keys, run testnet/shadow to accumulate resolved trades, let graduation clear, then tiny mainnet caps. (Candle feed + regime: DONE. Wait→follow-up loop: DONE.) Optional follow-ups: webhook/email alert tailing alerts-<net>.log; live testnet native-trigger reconciliation.
- Blocked by: none. (Phase 1 live testnet order, Phase 3 shadow, Phase 4 config-tuner LLM, Phase 5 real graduation — all deferred pending keys.)

---

## 📍 LAST ACTION

- Did: follow-ups to the wait loop — a tripped breaker now FREEZES re-checks (`due=[]` when breaker_tripped; parked candidates keep attempts until it clears); `exec report` surfaces `deferred` count, `exec status` notes it (human view). 170 pass.
- Then (prior): built the wait→follow-up loop. Decision tool gains `recheck_in_minutes` (validator clamps to [0,1440]; missing→None); `Decision.recheck_in_minutes`; new `HL_FOLLOWUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` cap (default 3, 0=disabled). New `deferred` table + `defer_candidate`/`due_deferred`/`drop_deferred`/`deferred_count` + `DeferredCandidate`. Runner refactored: extracted `_evaluate`+`_fire_and_reconcile` (shared by intake + deferral re-check loops), `_wait` intercepts act+wait BEFORE the gate to park (HWM still advances; gate stays pure), `_schedule_recheck` clamps next-check WITHIN freshness (None⇒terminal reject when no room/attempts). PassSummary +`rechecked`/`deferred`. Due deferrals re-checked first each pass with fresh data; skipped in dry_run.
- Result: 169 pass; keyless invariant re-verified
- File(s) touched: hlcli/core/{config,types}.py, hlcli/executor/{decision,runner}.py, hlcli/state/store.py, hlcli/cli/commands/exec_.py, tests/{_helpers,test_executor,test_decision}
- Prior: candle feed + deterministic regime (MarksFeed.candles, executor/regime.py, enrich/runner wiring). `MarksFeed.candles` (keyless /info candleSnapshot, lookback×interval window) + `Exchange.get_candles` on both backends; new `executor/regime.py` (Kaufman efficiency-ratio classify→trend/range/None at <20 bars; compact 12-bar `summarize`); runner gathers per-coin context once (best-effort `_fetch_candles`, degrades on feed failure), feeds `enrich(candles=, regime=)`; regime now reaches the gate. (Prior: decision.py P1 rationale-first tool order, P2 temperature-by-model guard, P3 conviction anchor + execution-trader persona.)
- Result: 162 pass; keyless-import invariant re-verified in /tmp/hlcore
- File(s) touched: hlcli/core/types.py, hlcli/exchange/{marks,base,paper,hyperliquid}.py, hlcli/executor/{regime(new),enrich,runner,decision}.py, tests/{_helpers,test_regime(new),test_marks,test_executor}

## 🧠 DECISIONS

- [2026-06-27] LLM owns judgment, code owns mechanics + safety; LLM output is gate input, never a bypass
- [2026-07-01] wait→follow-up: act+wait is DEFERRED not rejected — runner intercepts WAIT before the gate (gate stays pure), parks in `deferred` table, HWM still advances. Re-check scheduled WITHIN max_signal_age (clamped; no room⇒terminal reject). attempts = HL_FOLLOWUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS re-checks (default 3); each re-check uses FRESH enrich/candles/regime. Due deferrals processed before new intake; skipped in dry_run AND while breaker tripped (frozen, attempts intact). `exec report.deferred` + `exec status` note surface the parked count.
- [2026-06-27] hard caps in .env (off-limits to LLM/tuner); tunable surface in config/active_config.json, clamped on load
- [2026-06-27] anthropic + live-exchange deps lazy-imported so paper + tests run without keys/signing libs
- [2026-06-27] Order-path model claude-sonnet-4-6; daily tuner claude-opus-4-8
- [2026-06-27] Idempotency key (candidate id) recorded BEFORE fire → crash skips (missed trade), never double-fires
- [2026-06-27] Candidate side inferred from level geometry (long: sl<entry<tp); incoherent → rejected at intake + gate
- [2026-06-27] Paper book persists in state-<network>.db; manual paper (no state) stays in-memory
- [2026-06-30] Decision: out-of-range conviction is CLAMPED; bad enum / missing / non-numeric is DROPPED (never guessed). regime left None (no price-history feed); shadow=`fire_enabled=False` (logs+advances HWM) vs dry_run (mutates nothing)
- [2026-06-30] Phase 4: executor-side resolver writes trade outcomes (SL/TP at trigger price, expiry at mark). Tuners clamp on propose+promote+load, sample-gated (no cohort ⇒ no model call); propose→approve everywhere (§13 Q4)
- [2026-06-30] Candles: keyless /info candleSnapshot (15m, lookback 48, once per coin per pass, uncached, best-effort). Regime computed in CODE (Kaufman ER, threshold 0.35, <20 bars⇒None) not by the LLM — feeds the gate + a 12-bar OHLC tail to the model. Decision tool reordered rationale-first; temperature sent only to models that accept it.
- [2026-06-30] Phase 5 (§13 Q6): native SL/TP is a HARD mainnet prereq — enforced at runtime (unprotectable live entry → emergency MARKET close, status `aborted`, no ledger, key already spent so no re-fire). Triggers scoped to testnet+mainnet (resolver closes via reduce-only MARKET there; paper keeps LIMIT-at-level). Graduation thresholds are hard caps. Alerts = JSONL+stderr (no deps/keys), None in shadow.

## ⚠️ GOTCHAS

- §13 open questions have default choices (LLM scope, candidate source, news input, tuner autonomy, cadence, native SL/TP). Confirm with user before a task relies on one — don't assume.
- Keep no top-level imports of anthropic / hyperliquid / eth_account in hot paths (breaks paper + tests). Verified by `/tmp/hlcore` venv (no exchange extra).
- Marks/book/reads go through **httpx** `/info` (core dep), NOT SDK `Info` — don't "simplify" onto the SDK or paper stops being keyless. SDK+eth_account are write-only (signing).
- Tunable values must never reach the order path unclamped.
- Executor entry is a MARKET order (gate), so a live `accepted` means `filled`; the runner records open_trade + sizes protection from `OrderResult.filled_size`/`avg_price`, NOT the intended order. Paper fixtures have mark==entry so counts/P&L are unchanged. Don't revert to a GTC limit entry — it reintroduces phantom-position tracking (review finding H1).
- Python 3.12 is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12` (system default is 3.11; project needs ≥3.12).
- Executor tests inject `run_once(..., decide_fn=...)` (act_now/drop in _helpers) so the LLM is never hit; real `decide`/tuners tested via FakeClient/FakeTool/FakeText. `exec`/`tune run` (with eligible cohort) need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; empty stream / gated tuner skip the call.
- Tuner artifacts live beside `config_path`: proposed_/active_ config.json + prompt.md + promotions.jsonl. Tests MUST pass an isolated `caps(config_path=tmp/...)` or they write into repo `config/`. `tune` uses network-scoped state db for resolved trades.
