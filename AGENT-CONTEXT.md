# AGENT-CONTEXT

> Last updated: 2026-07-06 | Session: Sentry 6a (committed) + 6b LLM shadow built & live-verified; 312 tests pass; next = 6c gated live ↓risk actions

---

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK

- Task: "Sentry" — in-trade manager (Phase 6, PLAN.md §14); scope user-confirmed: manages open positions + enters deferred WAITs, never originates
- Goal: 6a mechanics ✅ → 6b LLM shadow vs baseline ✅ → 6c gated live ↓risk actions → 6d ADD
- Status: 6b complete, uncommitted (6a committed by user). Gates passed; shadow evidence now accumulates operationally via `sentry run --shadow`
- Next action: 6c — management gate (first-failure: schema → breaker ↓risk-only → cooldown/rate caps → action checks → rounding → idempotency), new `.env` hard caps (actions/position/day, LLM calls/day, min interval, opposing-action window), then live hold/tighten/reduce/close/extend_tp on paper→testnet
- Blocked by: none (6c go/no-go ideally reads accumulated shadow agreement data first)

---

## 📍 LAST ACTION

- Did: built Phase 6b — `sentry/decision.py` (strict `submit_management`, HOLD-default prompt, drop-never-guess validation, no ADD), `sentry/context.py` (thesis via new store getters `intake_candidate`/`decision_for`/`sentry_for_trade`, 15m+1h frames, prior actions), `sentry/shadow.py` (proposal paired with 6a baseline, `agrees`, `shadow_dropped`), watch pass = `run_once(include_intake=False)` (deferred re-entry on sentry cadence, intake untouched), CLI `sentry shadow`/`run --shadow`/status scoreboard; `supports_temperature` → core/llm.py
- Result: 312 pass (29 new); live sonnet shadow call on paper produced a sane thesis-aware tighten_stop at +0.2R vs idle baseline, fired nothing; docs/ACTION-ITEMS synced
- File(s) touched: hlcli/sentry/{decision,context,shadow}.py (new), core/llm.py, executor/{decision,runner}.py, state/store.py, cli/commands/sentry.py, tests/test_sentry_shadow.py (new), ACTION-ITEMS.md, docs/{modules,decisions}.md

## 🧠 DECISIONS

- [2026-06-27] LLM owns judgment, code owns mechanics + safety; LLM output is gate input, never a bypass
- [2026-06-27] hard caps in .env; tunable surface clamped on load; anthropic + exchange deps lazy; sonnet-4-6 order path / opus-4-8 tuner; idempotency key recorded BEFORE fire
- [2026-07-01] wait→follow-up: act+wait DEFERRED not rejected; re-check inside freshness, `HL_FOLLOWUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; frozen while breaker tripped; re-checks labeled via `followup` in context
- [2026-07-02] Non-finite numbers NEVER clamp: NaN slides through min/max as the UPPER bound, so conviction/recheck are dropped and tunables fall back to defaults (`math.isfinite` everywhere a clamp guards money)
- [2026-07-02] Gate mark-sanity: the entry is a MARKET order ⇒ mark must exist, sit strictly inside sl/tp, and R:R **at the mark** must clear the floor; sizing + notional/leverage caps priced at the mark, not the proposed entry
- [2026-07-02] Ledger-first fills: trades row written on fill BEFORE protection; failed protection ⇒ emergency close + cancel placed triggers + row resolved `aborted` (was: no ledger). Positions the ledger doesn't know raise an edge-triggered `unmanaged_position` alert
- [2026-07-02] Shadow books hypothetical trades (`trades.shadow=1`, entry at mark) resolved orderlessly — THIS is the tuner/graduation training data; shadow passes never touch real trades; hypothetical book honors one-per-coin
- [2026-07-05] Sentry (PLAN.md §14): deterministic mechanics FIRST (6a trail engine, all rules default off) → 6b LLM shadow judged vs that baseline → 6c gated live ↓risk → 6d ADD last; sentry never originates trades (user-confirmed: manages positions + enters deferred WAITs)
- [2026-07-05] R anchors to `initial_sl` once the stop ratchets; a profit-side stop-out books `won`; `scaled` partials count as wins; live stop replace = place-new-then-cancel-old (reject ⇒ old level kept everywhere); scale-out idempotent via `sentry:scale:<id>` recorded before the order
- [2026-07-06] 6b shadow-only: proposals logged PAIRED with the 6a baseline (baseline never in the model's context — no anchoring); `hl sentry once|run` = `run_once(include_intake=False)` watch pass (deferred re-entry shares attempts/idempotency with exec; intake stays exec's)

## ⚠️ GOTCHAS

- §13 open questions have default choices — confirm with user before a task relies on one.
- Keep no top-level imports of anthropic / hyperliquid / eth_account in hot paths. Verified 2026-07-02 in a fresh core-only venv (scratchpad `hlcore`; old `/tmp/hlcore` is PEP-668-locked, rebuild if needed).
- Marks/book/candles/meta go through **httpx** `/info`, NOT SDK `Info` — don't "simplify" onto the SDK or paper stops being keyless.
- PassSummary counters are disjoint: `rejected` = gate said no; `failed` = gate-approved but died at the exchange (reject/unfilled/aborted). Don't fold them back together.
- Executor entry is a MARKET order; ledger + protection size from `OrderResult.filled_size`/`avg_price`. Don't revert to GTC limit entry (review finding H1).
- test helpers' `caps()` pins `config_path=/nonexistent/...` so prompt/config reads never touch a dev's real `~/.hyperliquid-cli`; tuner tests still pass their own tmp `config_path`.
- Run tests with `.venv/bin/pytest` (bare python3.12 has no pytest). Python 3.12 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`.
- Sentry 6a is inert until the tunable `trail` rules are switched on (all default off); `hl sentry once` tells you when nothing is active.
- Executor tests inject `run_once(..., decide_fn=...)`; real `decide`/tuners tested via fakes. `exec`/`tune run` need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
- `resolved_trades(limit=N)` = most recent N (newest-closed first) — don't assume oldest-first.
- FakeLiveExchange (test_protect) models positions/open_orders/canceled; `fail_triggers="tp"` = partial-protection case.
